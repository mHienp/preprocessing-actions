## Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing automation with CML

* Using Github action, spatial and tabular preprocessing is automated and artifacts can be downloaded to be used as simulation inputs.

* CML (Continuous Machine Learning) is an open-source CLI tool which generates a visual report with results and metrics automatically on every pull request. The runner pulls the CML Docker image with `NodeJS`, `Python 3`, `DVC` and `CML` set up on an Ubuntu LTS base.

* View any [pull request](https://github.com/mHienp/preprocessing-actions/pulls) for an example report.
